                        Named after Synesthesia, the phenomenon of confusing multiple senses,
                        Synesthes.io is a gaming experience, complete with a custom controller,
                        that is enhanced by interaction with the world around us.

                    Design Requirements
                </h3>
                <p>
                   In order to improve upon modern gaming experiences by drawing from the conditions
                   of the real-world, Synesthes.io needed to achieve the following: 
                    <li>Player input from a controller</li>
                    <li>Synthesis of this data into game changes</li>
                    <li>Real-time game updates</li>
                </p>
<br><br>
                <h3>
                    Ideation
                </h3>
            <div class="project-container">
                <section class= "project-info">
                    <p>
                        I based the game around my own synesthesia experience (color -> sound). 
                        In order to synthesize sound data from the real world, the controller 
                        would include an electret microphone, which would pick up sound frequency 
                        data (pitch). Thus, with varying musical atmospheres and and sound environments,
                        the game would appear different to each user.
                    </p>
                </section>
                <div class="project-image">
                    <img src="../imgs\design\\.png" alt=""> </div>
                </div>
            </div>
            
                <br>
                <h3>Process</h3>
                Creating the game consisted of three main parts: creating the custom controller,
                creating the game interface, and integrating the two using a Serial Port.
                <br>
                <br>
                To create the controller, I attached an Arduino Uno to a simple plastic plate.
                I added a BNO055 orientation sensor to detect the roll, pitch, and yaw of the 
                controller, as well as an SPW2430 microphone to collect sound frequency data from the player's
                encvironment. 
                <div class="project-image">
                    <img src="../imgs\design\\.png" alt=""> </div>
                </div>
                <br>
                I created the game interface in Unity, modeling all 3D assets within the software.
                It is a simple "infinite runner" style game, with a player manuvering around
                obstacles followed by a camera. When the player falls off the platform and hits lava,
                the game resets, but otherwise runs forever.
                <br>
                <br>
                The controller communicates to the game through the Serial port, which involved integration 
                from C++ to C#.                

                <h3>Programming</h3>
                


                <h3>Final Product</h3>
                The final product includes several design features which address our original design requirements:
                <ul>
                    <li>Sound: f-holes and the semi-hollow body produces a warm sound while limiting feedback. 1 tone and 1 volume knob
                        allow the user to further control sound quality. </li>
                    <li>Comfort: the semi-hollow body makes the guitar lightweight. We also made the guitar body slim,
                        so the player can easily strum.
                    </li>
                    <li>Style: f-holes double as a classic jazz style feature, as well as the oiled, wooden body.</li>
                    <li>Affordability: through our BOM calculations, the guitar costs less than $200 to produce, beating out
                        our market comparisons.</li>
                </ul>
