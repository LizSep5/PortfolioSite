                        In pursuit of quality sound and style, our team created "Gloria," 
                        a jazz guitar that looks as good as it sounds, and won't break the bank.

                    Design Persona/Requirements
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Our persona, Gloria, is an intermediate jazz guitar player who is looking for a guitar with consistent sound
                    quality. After a competitive analysis of the current market, our team decided to innovate 
                    upon the classic jazz guitar model by providing similar sound quality and tone for a more affordable price.
                    We chose the following design requirements:
                    <li>Sound: Warm and resonant</li>
                    <li>Feel: Comfortable</li>
                    <li>Look: Classic and stylish</li>
                    <li>Price Point: Affordable</li> 
                </p>
<br><br><br>
                <h3>
                    Ideation
                </h3>
            <div class="project-container">
                <section class= "project-info">
                    <p>
                        Our Ideation process began with brainstorming ~100 ideas and each team member choosing
                        their top two to flesh out in a sketch. From there, we each prototyped a low-fidelity model of our
                        favorite. We analyzed these three ideas through a Feasibility vs. Attractivness
                        ranking, eventually combining aspects from each design to land at the most attractive product for
                        our timeline, "Gloria."
                    </p>
                </section>
                <div class="project-image">
                    <img src="../imgs\design\guitar\GuitarSketch.png" alt="Guitar Sketch"> </div>

                <br>
                <h3>Process</h3>
                As the CAD lead, I modeled our final design in Fusion360 so we could visualize
                the parts we would need to assemble our guitar.
                <br>
                <br>
                We created our high-fidelity prototype out of the provided cutting board, using a bandsaw
                 and scroll saw to cut the body and details. I soldered the electronics and we conducted
                several tests before assembly to ensure our pickup produced a sonsistently clean sound.
                <br><br><div class="project-image">
                    <img src="../imgs\design\guitar\GuitarCAD1.png" alt="Guitar CAD1"> </div>
                </div>
                <br><br>
                <h3>Final Product</h3>
                <div class="project-image">
                    <img src="../imgs\design\guitar\GuitarHIFI.png" alt="Guitar High Fidelity"> </div>
                </div>
                <br>
                The final product includes several design features which address our original design requirements:
                
                    <li>Sound: f-holes and the semi-hollow body produces a warm sound while limiting feedback. 1 tone and 1 volume knob
                        allow the user to further control sound quality. </li>
                    <li>Comfort: the semi-hollow body makes the guitar lightweight. We also made the guitar body slim,
                        so the player can easily strum.
                    </li>
                    <li>Style: f-holes double as a classic jazz style feature, as well as the oiled, wooden body.</li>
                    <li>Affordability: through our BOM calculations, the guitar costs less than $200 to produce, beating out
                        our market comparisons.</li>
