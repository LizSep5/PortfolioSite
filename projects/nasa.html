                        As one of 57 winners of NASA Techrise's inaugural competition, I worked with
                         my high school engineering class to design and fabricate an instrumentation 
                         payload that collected data at the edge of space in a hot air balloon. The payload, Atmospheric Collection 
                         of Noxious Gases, aimed to combat issues of climate and pollution with high-tech data 
                         collection methods.

                    Design Requirements
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Our experiment had to align with numerous NASA guidelines in order to ensure proper 
                    performance in the harsh conditions of outer space, including the following:
                    <li>Withstand temperatures as low as -40 degrees F</li>
                    <li>Perform consistently in a 0 pressure environment </li>
                    <li>Fit into a 4"x4"x8" cubesat</li>
                </p>

                    Design and Build
                </h3>

                    <p>
                        To test the air at the edge of space for pollution, our team designed an
                        instrumentation payload for the hot air balloon, choosing to use an Arduino REV 3
                        for its small physical size and large memory.
                        
                        After planning our design in Onshape, our team constructed the payload structure
                        using laser cut wood panels, attaching sensors to a custom circuit board seperate 
                        from the Arduino.

                <br><br>
                <h3>Programming</h3>
                I worked with a team to obtain PM2.5 readings from the PMSA003I sensor, as well 
                as obtain altitude and temperature data from the DPS310 and BNO055. I also monitored sensor 
                readings during our 0-pressure test at Harvard University’s vacuum chamber to ensure that 
                even in a vacuum environment, our gas sensors would still intake particulates.

                <h3>Final Product</h3>
                Our payload launched on July 21st, 2023. It sucessfully collected 4 hours of data over the Midwest
                United States during a time when the California wildfires were raging strong. We shared this data with NASA and various other researchers to
                contribute to climate research
