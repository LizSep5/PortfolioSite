                    <p>Instrumentation & Automation II | Sewanhaka High School</p>
                    <br>
                    <h4>Completed:</h4> June, 2022
                    <br><h4>Timeline:</h4> 6 Months (~8 hrs/week)

                    <p>
                        As one of 57 winners of NASA Techrise's inaugural competition, I worked with
                         my high school engineering class to design and fabricate an instrumentation 
                         payload that collected data at the edge of space in a hot air balloon. The payload, Atmospheric Collection 
                         of Noxious Gases, aimed to combat issues of climate and pollution with high-tech data 
                         collection methods.

                <h3>
                    Design Requirements
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Our experiment had to align with numerous NASA guidelines in order to ensure proper 
                    performance in the harsh conditions of outer space. Including the following:
                    <li>Able to withstand temperatures as low as -40 degrees F</li>
                    <li>Withstand pressure as low as</li>
                    <li>Fit into a 6"x6"x8" cubesat</li>
                </p>

                <h3>
                    Ideation
                </h3>
            <div class="project-container">
                <section class= "project-info">
                    <p>
                        Our Ideation process began with brainstorming ~100 ideas and each team member choosing
                        their top two to flesh out in a sketch. From there, we each prototyped a low-fidelity model of our
                        favorite. We analyzed these three ideas through a Feasibility vs. Attractivness
                        ranking, eventually combining aspects from each design to land at the most attractive product for
                        our timeline, "Gloria."

                <br>
                <h3>Process</h3>
                As the CAD lead, I modeled our final design in Fusion360 so we could visualize
                the parts we would need to assemble our guitar.
                <br>
                <br>
                We created our high-fidelity prototype out of the provided cutting board, utulizing tools like
                the bandsaw and scroll saw to cut the body and details. I soldered the electronics and we conducted
                several tests before assembly to ensure our pickup produced a sonsistently clean sound.

                <br>
                <h3>Final Product</h3>
                The final product includes several design features which address our original design requirements:
                <p>
                    <li>Sound: f-holes and the semi-hollow body produces a warm sound while limiting feedback. 1 tone and 1 volume knob
                        allow the user to further control sound quality. </li>
                    <li>Comfort: the semi-hollow body makes the guitar lightweight. We also made the guitar body slim,
                        so the player can easily strum.
                    </li>
                    <li>Style: f-holes double as a classic jazz style feature, as well as the oiled, wooden body.</li>
                    <li>Affordability: through our BOM calculations, the guitar costs less than $200 to produce, beating out
                        our market comparisons.</li>
                    </p>
